# üõí Walmart Sales Data Analysis using SQL

## üìò Introduction

This project uses SQL to analyze Walmart's retail sales data with the goal of uncovering patterns in customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance. The analysis was performed on a structured dataset representing transactions from three different branches.

## üéØ Project Goals

- Analyze sales trends across branches and products
- Identify high-performing categories and customer segments
- Evaluate VAT, revenue, and gross income across different time periods
- Support data-driven decisions using clear and efficient SQL queries

## üßæ Dataset Summary

The dataset contains 1000 transaction records from three Walmart branches in **Yangon**, **Mandalay**, and **Naypyitaw**. Each entry provides detailed information about a customer purchase.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Process Overview

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preparation

- Created database and table using SQL  
- Inserted and validated 1000 rows of transaction data  
- Ensured data types and constraints (e.g., NOT NULL) for quality

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering

- `time_of_day`: Categorized into Morning, Afternoon, Evening  
- `day_name`: Extracted day of the week from `date`  
- `month_name`: Extracted month from `date`  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Analysis Using SQL

Used SQL queries to explore:
- Revenue by product line and city  
- Customer preferences by gender and type  
- Time-based sales patterns  
- Average rating distribution across branches

## üí∏ Revenue & Profit Calculation

```text
COGS = unit_price √ó quantity  
VAT = 5% √ó COGS  
Total = COGS + VAT  
Gross Income = Total - COGS  
Gross Margin % = Gross Income √∑ Total
